# Module-9-Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains the code and files related to the Module 9 Challenge. The challenge involves database design, data processing, and analysis.

## Files Included
1. **DBD.jpeg**: This JPEG file contains the Database Diagram (DBD) that illustrates the schema and relationships between the database tables.

2. **schemas.sql**: This SQL file includes the schema definitions for creating and referencing all the database tables. It defines the structure of the database.

3. **data_analysis.sql**: This SQL file contains the data processing and analysis for the challenge. Each double empty line represents the start of a new query or analysis step.

## Instructions
To review the database schema and structure, refer to the `schemas.sql` file. It provides an overview of the tables and their relationships.

To understand the data processing and analysis performed for the challenge, refer to the `data_analysis.sql` file. Each query or analysis step is separated by a double empty line for clarity.

## Usage
You can review the SQL files directly or import them into your preferred database management system (DBMS) to execute the queries and analyze the data.
